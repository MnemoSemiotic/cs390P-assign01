    Though I had been working in Cloud9, I decided to get Rails to work on my local machine.  I had used Mamp Pro in the past, and for some reason, the MAMP file tree had usurped the ruby control, making it impossible to update or get a rails build up and running.  I uninstalled MAMP and removed its entries from the hosts file.
    I attempted multiple times to upgrade the default Ruby version using brew and rbenv (https://onvinetech.wordpress.com/2017/05/26/how-to-install-ruby-on-rails-on-macos-sierra-10-12/).  However, when I checked ruby -v, it kept returning version 2.0.0.
    Eventually I decided to install RVM to see if that would strongarm the most recent version of Ruby into place.  I followed the tutorial at http://railsapps.github.io/installrubyonrails-mac.html.  Though this worked for the Ruby upgrade, I was still failing my rails build.  After running through the set of command line instructions five times, including reinstalling the x-code dev tools, I was able to build rails and run the server.  Below is the list of commands, in order, that I ran.

    $ brew install gpg
    $ command curl -sSl https://rvm.io/mpapis.asc | gpg --import -
    ## the above command was unable to establish encryption
    $ \curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable
    $ rvm get stable --autolibs=enable
    ## I ran the above command on attempts after the first one, since it is just an update for rvm

    ## to refresh the terminal
    $ source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm
    
    $ rvm install ruby-2.4.1
    $ ruby -v
    ## which returned ruby 2.4.1

    $ gem update --system
    ## I suspected the issue was in some sort of gem corruption, though ultimately I belive reinstalling x-code dev tools was the key

    $ gem update
    ## I ran this to follow the tutorial, though I am unsure how it is different from the prior gem update command

    $ gem install bundler
    ## My install seemed to be failing on bundler, but I'm not convinced that that was the problem.  At any rate, this install did fine.

    $ gem install nokogiri
    ## this failed a couple times

    $ rvm use ruby-2.4.1@rails5.1 --create
    $ gem install rails
    
    $ mkdir workspace
    ## for projects, sitting in my cs390P folder

    $ cd workspace
    $ mkdir appName
    $ cd appName
    $ rvm use ruby-2.4.1@appName --ruby-version --create
    $ gem install rails
    $ rails new .

    Obviously there's some redundancy in the above, but this is what worked.  I have tried many times in the past to install a rails build, but I think other environments have always been conflicting.  I think the above set of commands can get me to a sort of ground zero.

    Created a git repository for the assignment 1 project and put my assignOneLog.txt document into it.  AssignOneLog.txt is where I'm keeping notes about what I'm doing generally. 
    I used $ rails new profpanel to create the rails app.  I ran rails server in the profpanel directory and the application ran successfully (Screen Shot 2017-09-12 at 6.55.23 P).
